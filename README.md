Zero Effort Github Contributions
================================
Arguably unethical.
A script to automate github contributions. Gotta make that bar all nice and green.

###Usage:
- Make a dummy repository for your automated contributions
- Set USER and REPO variables in Contribs.py
- Set maximum commits variable in Contribs.py
- Run Contribs.py
- Run fillit.sh
